# STARKs x Bitcoin Track

A [btc++ Scaling Edition hackathon](https://btcplusplus.dev/conf/istanbul#hackathon) track exploring the intersection of STARKs and Bitcoin.

## Overview

This track challenges participants to explore and develop projects that leverage STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) for Bitcoin or its symbiotic ecosystem (including Nostr, Cashu, Lightning, Ark, Liquid, and more).

## Technical Scope

While the ideal outcome would be to generate and verify a STARK proof, we understand the time constraints of a 3-hour hackathon. Projects that successfully implement logic in Cairo and run Cairo programs will be fully eligible for prizes.

Verification options include:

- Browser-based verification using the STWO WASM verifier
- Command-line verification via [Scarb CLI](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs.html)

The possibilities are endless, be creative, harness the power of STARKs and Cairo, and have fun!

## Prize Pool

**Total Prize: 2,000,000 sats**

Prize distribution will be determined based on the number of participating teams and the quality of submitted projects.
